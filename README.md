**EDA Helper** is a Python package designed to streamline your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process. It provides a collection of helper functions to quickly analyze, visualize, and summarize datasets. Whether you're working with numeric, categorical, or datetime data, this package has you covered!

## Credits üôè

This package is inspired by the brilliant work of [@MisbahullahSheriff](https://github.com/MisbahullahSheriff). The original EDA helper functions were created by him, and I have extended and organized them for easier use. Additional functions and improvements have been added by me ([@shemanto27](https://github.com/shemanto27)).

## Installation üì¶

You can install the package via `pip`:

```bash
pip install my_eda_helper
```

For Google Colab users, install it directly in your notebook:
```bash
!pip install my_eda_helper
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Import the Package
```python
import my_eda_helper as eda
```

### 2. High-Level Analysis

#### Missing Data

**Find Missing Values:**
```python
missing_data = eda.missing_info(df)
print(missing_data)
```

**Plot Missing Data:**
```python
eda.plot_missing_info(df)
```

#### Correlation Analysis

**Numeric Features (Pearson/Spearman):**
```python
eda.correlation_heatmap(df)
```

**Categorical Features (Cramer's V):**
```python
eda.cramersV_heatmap(df)
```

#### Pair Plots
```python
eda.pair_plots(df)
```

### 3. Detailed Analysis

#### Numeric Features

**Summary:**
```python
eda.num_summary(df, "Age")
```

**Univariate Plots:**
```python
eda.num_univar_plots(df, "Fare")
```

**Bivariate Plots:**
```python
eda.num_bivar_plots(df, "Age", "Fare")
```

#### Categorical Features

**Summary:**
```python
eda.cat_summary(df, "Sex")
```

**Univariate Plots:**
```python
eda.cat_univar_plots(df, "Embarked")
```

**Bivariate Plots:**
```python
eda.num_cat_bivar_plots(df, "Fare", "Sex")
```

### Hypothesis Testing

**Numeric vs Numeric:**
```python
eda.num_num_hyp_testing(df, "Age", "Fare")
```

**Numeric vs Categorical:**
```python
eda.num_cat_hyp_testing(df, "Fare", "Sex")
```

**Categorical vs Categorical:**
```python
eda.hyp_cat_cat(df, "Sex", "Survived")
```
